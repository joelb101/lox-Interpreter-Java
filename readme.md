# Toy-Interpreter-Java

It's based on the principles and techniques taught in the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes raw source code into a stream of tokens.
- **Parsing**: Converts the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Interpretation**: Executes the AST directly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/joelb101/toy-interpreter-java.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd toy-interpreter

3. Compile the Java files
   javac *.jav

### Usage

To run your code using the interpreter, use the following command:
   java Main yourfile.lox
Replace `yourfile.lox` with the path to the `.lox` file you want to interpret.
